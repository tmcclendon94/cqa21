        <p>
            I started this credit repair business with a passion to help others. <br>
            There were too many minorities with little to no credit due to the <br>
            lack of education. I too had my own issues with building credit and <br>
            keeping it steady, due to the minor mistake of not knowing the truth. <br>
            I was a victim of fraud and also someone who did not know how credit <br>
            utilization can really hurt your score. I was also unaware that you <br>
            can dispute inaccurate data on your credit report. That too can hurt <br>
            your report. I am here today to help my community get educated on all <br>
            things credit by someone they can trust while repairing their credit <br>
            in the process.
